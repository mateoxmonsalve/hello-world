# hello-world

I’m an Economist with interest in Data Science and understanding the cause of things. Over the last 4 years I’ve worked in banking and financial consulting. Before working full time I also did internships in companies in a variety of industries from beverage manufacturing to car retail. I’m currently doing a MSc in Big Data, Marketing & Management to complement my earlier studies in Economics and to get a more practical set of skills that will allow me to enter an exponentially growing industry.

When I’m not studying or working, I’m drawing or painting. I love drawing everything that I see.
